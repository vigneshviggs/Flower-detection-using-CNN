# Flower-detection-using-CNN

This tutorial detects the types of flowers using Convolutional Neural Networks. A model is built using keras.Sequential model.

## Libraries:

* **PIL** for support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
* **OS** provides functions for interacting with the operating system.
* **Keras** for model building.
* **Matplotlib** for data visualization.
